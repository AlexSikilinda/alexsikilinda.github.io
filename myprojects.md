## Piano 3D
Piano 3D is a Windows Store app which has been downloaded more than 600,000 times and [featured in Microsoft TV advertisment](/posts/piano3d-featured-in-MS-advertisment/).
I am currently in process of creating new UI for this app and also porting it to other platforms. Piano 3D was written using Unity 3D and customized subset of NAudio library.
3D models were created using Blender. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTFeqLeryrE) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JhGnCrwEqA) videos to get a basic understanding of the app.

## Irregular Verbs Trainer
When I started learning English there wasn't a suitable app for learning irregular verbs in Windows Store. So I decided to create one. It was written in C# using MVVM approach (Prism library).
It allows a user to easily find all three forms and also has some practicing capabilities.
