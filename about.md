### Who am I?

Hi, my name is Alex Sikilinda. I live in Kharkov, Ukraine.

I decided to become a programmer when I was 9, when my brother showed me a Basic program on ZX-Spectrum.
In school I learned Turbo Pascal visiting additional classes and participating in various programming competitions. 
After school I started learning software engineering at my local university called [KhNURE](http://nure.ua/). 
Since then I mostly program in C#. In 2014 I started working as a developer in local software companies and also got my bachelor degree.

I got my first job in a company called ITCraft where I developed ecommerce web solution. The main site was written in ASP.NET MVC 3, but we used a lot of 
other technologies such as Web Forms, Endeca (search server), SSIS packages, Windows Services etc. I left ITCraft after about one year not because I didn't like
the project or the team, but because I wanted to know how software is developed in other companies.

Since then I've been working in a company called Langate as a .NET developer. The project is B2B multi tenant application written using modern stack and hosted in Azure.
Technologies we use: ASP.NET MVC and Web.Api, Azure Storage, Service Bus queues etc.

I also develop [my own projects](/myprojects/) and teach .NET in [BrainAcademy](http://brainacad.kh.ua/).

My professional goal is to get a job in Microsoft or StackOverflow. You may ask "Why these companies?" The answer is quite straightforward: I consider them the best place for .NET developer.
I am also excited about my app [Piano 3D](/myprojects/) which has been downloaded more than 600,000 times and even [featured in Microsoft TV advertisment](/posts/piano3d-featured-in-MS-advertisment/),
so I am constantly improving it and want to make it the best mobile piano app.

### What is this blog about?

This blog is about my journey in software development world, although I do not promise to post only about programming.
Since I develop [my own apps](/myprojects/) there will be a lot of articles about them.

### What are my hobbies?

I [play the piano](https://soundcloud.com/alex-sikilinda) and I am learning to play the guitar (mostly electric). Sometimes I pretend to compose music,
but you aren't gonna hear it, at least yet :)
I used to play basketball and volleyball, I haven't done it recently though because of my knee injury which I got playing basketball.
One of my passions is space and space technologies in particular, so I am really excited about all these new space-related private companies such as SpaceX, 
Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin etc.
