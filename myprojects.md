## Piano 3D (iOS, Android)

A piano app for IPhone and Android. Download from [piano3d.com](https://piano3d.com).
Besides basic piano functions it also has simplified tutorials users can learn.
Initially I created app for Windows Store only but I ported it to iOS and Android later.
You can read the whole story [here](/posts/piano3d-released-worldwide-on-ios-and-android/).
Currently I develop and support only this version.

## Piano 3D (Windows Store)
The Windows Store app has been downloaded more than 760,000 times and [featured in Microsoft TV advertisment](/posts/piano3d-featured-in-MS-advertisment/).
Written using Unity 3D and customized subset of NAudio library.
3D models were created using Blender. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTFeqLeryrE) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JhGnCrwEqA) videos to see Piano 3D from Windows Store in action.

## Irregular Verbs Trainer
When I started learning English there wasn't a suitable app for learning irregular verbs in Windows Store. So I decided to create one. It was written in C# using MVVM approach (Prism library).
It allows a user to easily find all three forms and also has some exercises.
