2023 is over, so it's time to review this blog's numbers!

The second half of 2023 was the period when I published a lot of useful articles which resulted in some traffic increase from Google and other search engines.

For the previous few months, the blog has been getting 40 unique visitors a day (1.2k a month). Let's see who those people are and what they are looking for.

## 2024

Unfortunately, my home, Ukraine, is still being attacked by russia, which of course doesn't particularly help with blogging, but let's hope 2024 will be better for everyone.
