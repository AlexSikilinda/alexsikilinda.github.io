<img src='/public/images/OldBlogDesign.png' alt="old design of this blog"/>

It's been a long time since I started this blog, and I was never very too happy about the design, but now it's finally changing.

The new design switches to a dark mode, introduces new fonts and styles, fixes some bugs and hopefully gives a better experience overall.

This post was created only for sentimental purposes - to keep a screenshot of the old look. Anyway, hope you will like the new design, and let's say goodbye to the old one!
