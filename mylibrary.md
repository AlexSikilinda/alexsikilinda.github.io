My Library is a place where I list all the books I have read since 03/13/2017.
A book may or may not have some kind of summary, but if I read it, it will get here.
The goal is to read at least one book in a week.
Here we go:

* Peter Thiel. Zero to One. Notes on startups, or how to build the future. (03/13/2017)
* Performance Reviews. Harvard Business Review Press (04/25/2017)
