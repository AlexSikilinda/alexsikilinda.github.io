## Piano 3D (iOS, Android)

A piano app for IPhone and Android. Download from [piano3d.com](https://piano3d.com).
Besides basic piano functions it also has simplified tutorials users can learn.
Initially I created app for Windows Store only but I ported it to iOS and Android later.
You can read the whole story [here](/posts/piano3d-released-worldwide-on-ios-and-android/).
Currently I develop and support only this version.

## Irregular Verbs Trainer
When I started learning English there wasn't a suitable app for learning irregular verbs in Windows Store. So I decided to create one. It was written in C# using MVVM approach (Prism library).
It allows a user to easily find all three forms and also has some exercises. Eventually has transformed into new app called "Do Did Done".
